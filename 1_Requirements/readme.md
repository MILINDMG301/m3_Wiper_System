# INTRODUCTION
 Wiper is an essential component that used to wipe raindrops or any water from the vehicle's windscreen.Most wipers have a low and a high speed, as well as an intermittent setting. When the wipers are on low and high speed, the motor runs continuously. But in the intermittent setting, the wipers stop momentarily between each wipe.
A wiper speed control system for an automotive wiper controls the operational speed of a wiper in accordance with rain conditions.

# SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS
STM32 CUBE IDE

# COMPONENTS
STM32F4O7VG MICROCONTROLLER BOARD

# DESCRIPTION
STM32F407VG
The STM32F407VG family is based on the high-performance Arm® Cortex®-M4 32-bit RISC core operating at a frequency of up to 168 MHz.The STM32F407VG family incorporates high-speed embedded memories (Flash memory up to 1 Mbyte, up to 192 Kbytes of SRAM), up to 4 Kbytes of backup SRAM, and an extensive range of enhanced I/Os.It offers three 12-bit ADCs, two DACs, a low-power RTC, twelve general-purpose 16-bit timers including two PWM timers for motor control, two general-purpose 32-bit timers.

# FEATURES OF STM32F407VG MICROCONTROLLER
In a LQFP100 package, the STM32F407VGT6 microcontroller has a 32-bit ARM Cortex-M4 with FPU core, 1-Mbyte Flash memory, and 192-Kbyte RAM.
On-board ST-LINK/V2 or ST-LINK/V2-A on STM32F4 DISCOVERY (old reference) or STM32F407G-DISC1 (new order code)
USB ST-LINK with three separate interfaces and re-enumeration capability.
Virtual Com port Debug port (with new order code only)
Large-scale storage (with new order code only)
Board power is supplied through USB or an external 5 V supply source.
3 V and 5 V external application power supply

# USES
These microcontrollers are used in a variety of applications, from simple printers to complex circuit boards in vehicles.
This Microcontroller is utilised in printing and scanning machines ,heat ventilation, air conditioning, and security systems.
This module can be found in a variety of household products.

# WORKING PRINCIPLE
Assume that the automobile is the microcontroller. After pressing the button for 2 seconds, the first led (red) should turn on, Clicking again the wiper will start, and the second led (blue) will turn on for a desired rate. If the button is pressed again, the third led (green) will turn on. The fourth press will turn on the fourth led (orange).The wiper speed will be increased in accordance with the each button press from previous one. The microcontroller (vehicle) is turned off even the led (red) will be turned off after pressing button for 2 seconds.

# WHAT IS WIPER SYSTEM
Wiper is an essential component that used to wipe raindrops or any water from the vehicle's windscreen.Windscreen wipers are necessary for maintaining sufficient view for the driver, especially in modern high-speed cars.

# WHY WIPER SYSTEM
It is needed to keep the windscreen clean enough to give adequate view at all times including raini conditions or fog conditions.

# WHEN SHOULD USE WIPER SYSTEM
The windshield wipers remove rain and snow from the windshield, while the headlights improve visibility at night.

# WHO DISCOVERED WIPER SYSTEM
Mark Anderson invented on 1902
