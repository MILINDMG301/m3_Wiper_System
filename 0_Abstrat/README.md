# Abstract

The aim of the project is to implement the Wiper Control System of the car. Wiper Control system is the an automotive wiper controls the operational speed of a wiper in accordance with rain conditions. The aim of proposed system here consists of 
STM32 microcontroller with the help of LEDs present on STM32. The proposed outcome of the project is, when Button pressed for 2 seconds the Wiper System should turn ON.Then the LEDs should turn on one after the other like the wiper system. When button again pressed for 2 Seconds the system needs to be OFF. But, The system would be smart that it should stop by coming to the starting LED.
